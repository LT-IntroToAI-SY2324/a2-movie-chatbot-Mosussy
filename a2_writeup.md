# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
Everything, I don't know why. Like I'm doing perfectly fine in AP CSA but when it comes to like coding in Python it's so different to me. I'm still getting used to it like syntax wise.



2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
We could use the match function in the same sort of way, but we would have to replace the elements in the pind list with words that are typically used to ask questions like what where when why so that the function can match it with words in the source list and just fill in the blanks.
